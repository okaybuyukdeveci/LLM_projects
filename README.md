# 🚀 LLM Projects Repository

Welcome to my repository! Here, I’ll be sharing all my projects focused on Large Language Models (LLMs), AI, and NLP. Each project demonstrates practical applications, machine learning models, and insights into different NLP tasks.


## 🤖 Sentiment Analysis (LSTM-based)
📋 Overview
This is my first project focused on Tweet Sentiment Analysis. The model uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture to predict the sentiment of tweets as either positive or negative with high accuracy.

### 🔧 Key Features

LSTM Model: Trained on a dataset of labeled tweets.
Accurate predictions: Differentiates between positive and negative sentiments effectively.
Real-World Applications: Can be applied in areas like customer feedback analysis, understanding trends, or content moderation.

### 🎯 Why it Matters?
✅ Understand customer feedback for brand management.
✅ Identify trends in real-time social media data.
✅ Assist with content moderation on various platforms.

### 🙏 Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by the tutorials and notebooks created by Imran & Daniel Bourke. Their resources were invaluable in helping me build this model. A huge thank you to them for their outstanding contributions to the machine learning community!
